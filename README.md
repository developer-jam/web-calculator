# web-calculator
A simple calculator project made from HTML, CSS (Bootstrap) &amp; JavaScript (JQuery)

A lot of the JS on here might be written in a way that feels like re-inventing the wheel but I mostly wanted to play around with flow control and logic tests on this project. In any case, I think it's a good project to look at if you're learning web dev.
